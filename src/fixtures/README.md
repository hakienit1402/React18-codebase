Fixtures

Purpose:

- Provide small, deterministic datasets for UI rendering, validation logic, and tests.

Guidelines:

- Keep data minimal and representative; avoid production secrets.
- Prefer numbers for numeric fields (not strings) to prevent parsing errors.
- Version-breaking changes should be coordinated with consumers.
